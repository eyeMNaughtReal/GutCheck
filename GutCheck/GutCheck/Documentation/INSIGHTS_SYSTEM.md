## ðŸ§® Insight Generation Algorithm

### Step 1: Data Collection
```swift
struct HealthData {
    let meals: [Meal]
    let symptoms: [Symptom]
    let activities: [Activity]
    let timeframe: DateInterval
}
```

### Step 2: Pattern Detection
1. **Time-Based Analysis:**
   ```swift
   func analyzeTimePatterns(data: HealthData) -> [TimePattern] {
       // Group symptoms by time of day
       // Calculate meal-to-symptom intervals
       // Identify peak symptom times
   }
   ```

2. **Food Analysis:**
   ```swift
   func analyzeFoodPatterns(data: HealthData) -> [FoodPattern] {
       // Group symptoms by consumed foods
       // Calculate ingredient frequencies
       // Identify common combinations
   }
   ```

3. **Lifestyle Analysis:**
   ```swift
   func analyzeLifestylePatterns(data: HealthData) -> [LifestylePattern] {
       // Correlate activities with symptoms
       // Analyze sleep impact
       // Consider stress factors
   }
   ```

### Step 3: Confidence Calculation

```swift
struct ConfidenceScore {
    let baseScore: Double          // Initial correlation strength
    let dataPoints: Int           // Number of occurrences
    let consistency: Double       // Pattern consistency
    let timespan: TimeInterval    // Data collection period
    
    var finalScore: Double {
        let dataFactor = min(dataPoints / 10, 1.0)
        let timeFactor = min(timespan.days / 30, 1.0)
        return baseScore * dataFactor * consistency * timeFactor
    }
}
```

## Medication Data Source

### Real-time HealthKit Integration

Medication data is sourced from Apple HealthKit using **real-time observers** rather than periodic polling. This approach provides several advantages:

#### **Real-time Updates (Recommended)**
- **Immediate Notification**: HealthKit notifies the app instantly when medication data changes
- **Battery Efficient**: Uses HealthKit's built-in observer pattern instead of background fetch
- **Better User Experience**: Users see medication updates in real-time
- **Background Delivery**: App can receive updates even when in background

#### **Implementation Details**
```swift
// Start observing medication changes
func startObservingMedications() async {
    let medicationTypes: [HKObjectType] = [
        .medicationDispenseType(),
        .medicationOrderType(),
        .medicationRecordType()
    ]
    
    for medicationType in medicationTypes {
        let query = HKObserverQuery(sampleType: medicationType, predicate: nil) { [weak self] _, completion, error in
            // Immediately fetch updated data when changes occur
            Task { @MainActor in
                await self?.fetchLatestMedications()
                completion()
            }
        }
        healthStore.execute(query)
    }
}
```

#### **Data Flow**
1. **User takes medication** â†’ Health app records it
2. **HealthKit detects change** â†’ Immediately notifies GutCheck
3. **App processes update** â†’ Fetches latest medication data
4. **UI updates** â†’ User sees medication in real-time
5. **Insights updated** â†’ Medication interactions analyzed

#### **Privacy & Security**
- **Local Processing**: All medication data processed on-device
- **Encrypted Storage**: Sensitive data encrypted with CryptoKit
- **No Cloud Sync**: Medication data never leaves the device
- **HealthKit Compliance**: Follows Apple's privacy guidelines

#### **Fallback Options**
- **Manual Entry**: Users can manually log medications if HealthKit unavailable
- **Offline Mode**: App functions without HealthKit connection
- **Data Recovery**: Local backup of medication history

### Alternative: Daily Polling (Not Recommended)
While possible, daily polling would:
- Use more battery
- Miss real-time medication events
- Provide poorer user experience
- Require background app refresh permissions
