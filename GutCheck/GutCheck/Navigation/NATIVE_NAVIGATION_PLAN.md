# Native Navigation Implementation Plan

## Completed:

1. Created core navigation components:
   - `AppRouter.swift` - Main navigation manager with path and sheet handling
   - `RefreshManager.swift` - Replaces DataSyncManager for data refresh coordination
   - `LogEntryView.swift` - Entry point for choosing what to log

2. Modified app structure:
   - `AppRoot.swift` - Replaces ContentView with native navigation
   - Updated `GutCheckApp.swift` to use AppRoot

3. Updated views to use native navigation:
   - `DashboardView.swift` - Now uses AppRouter and RefreshManager
   - `CalendarView.swift` - Partial update to use AppRouter

4. Created new view and viewmodel implementations:
   - `MealDetailView_New.swift` and `MealDetailViewModel_New.swift`
   - `SymptomDetailView_New.swift` and `SymptomDetailViewModel_New.swift`

## ✅ MIGRATION COMPLETED:

1. ✅ Updated all views to use AppRouter:
   - DashboardView, MealBuilderView, MealLoggingOptionsView
   - CustomTabBar, RecentActivityListView, LogMealView
   - TodaysActivitySummaryView, CalendarDetailView, MealConfirmationView
   - ContentView completely updated

2. ✅ Updated LogMealView and LogSymptomView to work with AppRouter
   - All views now use AppRouter instead of NavigationCoordinator
   - RefreshManager integration maintained

3. ✅ Navigation flows updated:
   - DashboardView → LogEntry → MealBuilder/LogSymptom
   - Calendar → MealDetail/SymptomDetail via AppRouter
   - Profile and settings navigation via sheet presentations

4. ✅ Removed NavigationCoordinator.swift and all references
   - File deleted, all functionality migrated to AppRouter

5. ✅ AppRouter enhanced with:
   - selectedTab property for tab management
   - Sheet presentation methods
   - Unified navigation patterns

## Implementation Notes:

- The new system eliminates mixed navigation paradigms by fully adopting SwiftUI's NavigationStack
- All navigation is centralized through AppRouter
- Sheet presentations are handled through AppRouter's activeSheet enum
- Data refreshes are triggered through RefreshManager
- Detail views now support loading by ID, making navigation more reliable
