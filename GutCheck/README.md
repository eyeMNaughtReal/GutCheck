# GutCheck üçΩÔ∏èüí©üìä

**GutCheck** is a personal iOS application designed to help users track and analyze their food intake and gastrointestinal symptoms using the power of LiDAR, AI, and Firebase.

---

## üöÄ Project Goals

- **Identify food triggers** that cause bloating, pain, and irregular bowel movements.
- **Leverage iPhone LiDAR** to estimate portion sizes.
- **Use AI to recognize food items** in meal photos.
- **Track nutritional details** (macros, allergens, additives, etc.)
- **Log bowel movements** with medical-grade accuracy using the Bristol stool chart.
- **Analyze patterns** between meals and symptoms to detect likely triggers.
- **Visualize trends** through charts, graphs, and trigger heatmaps.
- **Support export to CSV** and optionally sync with Apple Health.
